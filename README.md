# The Hacking Project - Movie Searcher


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to make an application that **asks for the name of a movie**, then returns the first 20 results containing :
* The name of the film,
* The release date,
* The director,
* and an image if there is one


**The live version : http://mxrch-movie-searcher.herokuapp.com/**

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_movie-searcher
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
